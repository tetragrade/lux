+ Characters have HP, Facets, and two slot-based inventories.
+ Other miscellaneous properties & abilities are described on the sheet in natural language, under "other features".
# Inventories.
+ Characters have two slot-based inventories (Light + Flesh). They can have at most 18 Light & 18 Flesh slots.
+ Fill and unlock your slots from lowest to highest.
+ Characters start with 4 Flesh slots, 4 Light slots, and 4 slots to assign freely.
\
&nbsp;
+ Flesh slots are for physical objects, such as Evidence, Means, & Wounds.
    + Evidence.
        + Evidence is any item that is being carried to support the truthfulness of a Secret.
    + Means.
        + Means are any item that is worth at least a day's Room & Board (R&B), or is a large or unusual tool.
	    + Currency should tracked in bundles worth a day's R&B. Handwave insubstantial amounts.
    + Wounds.
        + Wounds are damage to your body.
        + Remove 1 Wound each time you spend a full day resting in a safe area with access to medical treatment.
    + Other inconsequential items should be grouped in kits as Means, or handwaved.
\
&nbsp;
+ Light slots are for mental objects, such as Secrets, Favors, & Stress. <!-- This is intended as a storygame-type mechanic that produces a "setup scene, payoff scene" structure. First, you learn about the secret, and the characters must discuss it in order to add it to their inventory. Then, later, you must discuss it again in order to expose it. But secrets are a double-edged sword: a weak secret takes up light slots and is hard to remove, it makes it easier to hit critical stress.-->
    + Secrets.
        + When your character hears something that sounds secret, ask the other players (including the referee), if it sounds like a Secret. If they agree, add it to a Light slot with an appropriate description.
        + Secrets can only be removed by revealing them to another character, and causing a strong emotional reaction. This can inflict Stress, and can cause your character to level up (see Levelling Up).
        + If you didn't convert a secret to a Secret: your character didn't believe it, or consider it important. They can't treat it with sufficient gravitas for a shocking revalation.
        + Each character can only learn a given Secret once, and once a Secret is revealed by anyone, it's just news.
    + Favors.
        + A Favor represents a debt owed to you by an NPC.
        + If a favor isn't converted a Favor, your character forgot it or isn't willing to call it in for some reason.
    + Stress.
        + You gain Stress each time you act against one of your Facets (see Facets), or violate social convention (see Convention). Supernatural effects can also cause Stress.
        + Remove 1 Stress each time you spend a full day resting on the surface.
	+ Examples Stress causes:<br><table>
        <!--<th>Cause</th><th>Stress Gain</th>-->
        <!--<tr><td>rejected Facet</td><td>+ Facet die roll</td></tr>-->
        <tr><td>social attack i.e. insult or threat</td><td>variable, Referee's judgement</td></tr>
        <tr><td>flee a social conflict</td><td>+1</td></tr>
        <tr><td>shocked by reveal of Secret</td><td>+d6</td></tr>
        <tr><td>own compromising Secret revealed</td><td>max, fill all empty slots with Stress</td></tr>
        <tr><td>kill a person or attempt to<br>(once per scene)</td><td>+d4 Stress<br>(unless commanded by an external power, or sociopathic. PCs cannot be sociopaths)</td></tr>
    </table><!--the gain should always be +1, or +d-something, don't do +2,+3,... A stressor of that magnitude should create uncertainty.-->
# Saves.
+ When you attempt to do something for which the outcome is uncertain, the referee may call for a Save.
+ Roll a d20, lower is better. The rules & referee may add a modifier to represent the difficulty of tasks.
+ Calculate the total after modifiers. On a 0 or lower, you succeed. On an 19+ you fail. Otherwise, look at the corresponding slot:
    + If it requires mental effort, look at your Light.
    + If it requires physical effort, look at your Flesh.
\
&nbsp;		
+ If the slot is empty you succeed, otherwise you fail.
# Facets.
+ A Facet is a short phrase that relates to your character's behaviour. i.e.
    + Profession: "Blacksmith", "Doctor".
    + Personality Trait: "Calm", "Curious".
    + Ideology: "Obey the Gods", "Anarchist".
    + More Abstract: "Violence", "Opium Cravings".
+ Each Facet has an associated die size âˆˆ {d4, d6, d8 d10, d12}. This corresponds to its prominence.
\
&nbsp;
+ Whenever a save is made (by anyone in the scene) as a consequence of acting on one of your Facets, roll the die and modify the difficulty by the total, in your favor.
+ However, whenever you turn down an opportunity to act on a Facet, gain Stress equal to a roll of the die.
\
&nbsp;
+ You start with one d6 Facet and can have up to four.
+ Whenever you Level Up, you may choose to either:
    + Add a new d4 Facet.
    + Increase the die size of an existing Facet. 
    + Decrease the die size of an existing Facet.
+ d4 Facets can be replaced, given appropriate fictional positioning.
# Levelling Up.
+ Each time you shock an NPC by revealing Secrets (optionally supported by Evidence), you gain a slot (Light or Flesh, your choice).
+ Each Secret and Evidence can only be used in this way once, and each revelation must be greater than the last.
+ The target does not have to believe you to be shocked. If they are both shocked & convinced they are likely to become a permanent ally.
+ Each revelation must be greater than the last.
# Convention.
<!--My former o5r campaign Wormwood was intended to be about challenging conspiracies and other systems of control, and a key feature of those systems is that parts of them exist in your head. When I ran it in 5e I found that the rules failed to evoke this aspect. It was very easy to walk over the social conventions. They had no fangs. The only counter was intense physical security, which came across as a clear escalation and made the systems seem overtly sinister. There was no escalation. I wanted a gradual ramp-up as the characters become more comfortable breaking societal norms to reveal the conspiracy, that's what the interaction of stress and light levelling is intended to achieve.-->
+ During a social situation, the Referee declares any relevant aspects of social Convention. Characters that violate a Convention gain Stress.
+ The Conventions should be displayed in a way that makes them clear to the whole table, and can be modified at any time. i.e. the situation changes, the Referee realizes they made an error.
+ If, upon a player declaring an action, the Referee realizes that it would violate a previously unspoken Convention. That Convention is added to the list, and the player may cancel the action so it does not occur.		
+ Examples of Convention: never swear at this posh dinner (+1), never question the gods (+d4), always wear clothes (1/scene, +d6).
\
&nbsp;
# Disablement & Death.
+ Characters die when their Flesh slots are entirely full of Wounds.	
+ If a character gains stress with empty Light slots, but not enough to fit all the Stress, the remaining stress is disgregarded.
+ If they gain gain Stress with no free Light slots, they Break:
    + The first time: They lose their will to seek. They can no longer level up.
    + Subsequently: They roll on the break table \[TODO, makes your Facets suck].
+ After Breaking, they remove all Stress.
# Initiative & Combat.
+ If you can't take any more Stress, your can give up, or go to blows.
\
&nbsp;
+ Characters start with 0 HP, it is granted by protective equipment & magical means. They regain all HP after a minute-long rest.
+ Damage usually reduces HP. In some cases Damage inflicts an equal number of Wounds instead: when the target is immobilised, unsuspecting, or has 0 HP.
+ If the outcome of an attack is uncertain, the defender is always the one to Save. <!--this causes combat to accelerate as the death spiral takes hold. it also adds uncertainty at higher levels of play: information--, difficulty++-->
\
&nbsp;
+ A turn lasts a minute. Each turn, each character can move (20 ft by default), and spend AP. By default, characters have AP equal to their number of Flesh slots. They regain all AP at the start of each turn.
+ Example actions: make an attack (4 AP), move an extra time (4 AP), reveal a secret (4 AP), pick up or drop something (4 AP), fall or stand from prone (2 AP), draw or stow something (0 AP).
+ The referee decides the AP cost of other actions.
\
&nbsp;
+ Initiative is side-based. On the player turn, move clockwise around the table. The leader of the player party makes a Light Save: on a success the players act first, on a fail the enemies do.
+ If a character is visible to the enemy when initiative is determined, they cannot act during their side's first turn.
# Fleeing or Surrendering.
+ If a character tries to flee, the enemy leader may make a Flesh Save to prevent escape. Fleeing is only possible if there is a clear path of escape.
\
&nbsp;
+ You can choose to surrender at any time during a conflict, ignoring initiative.
+ Once you surrender, you cannot move or influence the conflict until the end of the scene.
+ Before the scene ends, the winning side has an opportunity to do whatever they want to surrendered foes.
